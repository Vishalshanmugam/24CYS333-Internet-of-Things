## Project Explanation
This IoT project automates the lighting system using motion and brightness detection. The system performs as follows:
1. *Motion Detection:* The PIR sensor activates the LED bulb when motion is detected.
2. *Brightness Control:* The LDR sensor ensures that lights adapt to the ambient light conditions.
3. *Energy Monitoring:* The system calculates and displays energy savings in real-time on a customer-facing dashboard.

## How It Works
1. *Detection Phase:* The PIR and IR sensors monitor the area for motion.
2. *Activation Phase:* The relay module activates the LED bulb upon detecting motion.
3. *Deactivation Phase:* The system turns off the light after a predefined interval of no motion.
4. *Dashboard Integration:* Energy efficiency statistics and conservation data are visualized on the customer endpoint dashboard.
